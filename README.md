# Old School Project

The "OS Project" is an open source Minecraft minigame plugin that brings classic minigames from 2012 to nowadays.

## Getting Started

Since this plugin isn't released in Spigot or Bukkit forums you'll need to compile it yourself. I suggest taking a read in this topic:

[Spigot Plugin Development](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-plugin-development/)

It's quite easy, but if you don't have experience with Bukkit development it might be tricky.

## Have fun!
